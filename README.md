The purpose of this study was to gain insights into the world of Soccer. Specifically, to better
understand the following questions: what makes a good player, what determines if a talented
young prospect will amount to a good player, and what determines a playerâ€™s value on the transfer
market. Our intentions are that this study is the first of several, and that it serves as a basis for
future exploration into the world of Soccer via Machine Learning and Deep Learning. The data
for our study revolves around the FIFA 18 video game by EA Sports. In our dataset the main
target variables were overall rating, potential rating, and metrics related to player value, whereas
our explanatory features were ratings on a multitude of features having to deal with player skill,
athleticism, intelligence and physicality.
In this analysis we were successfully able to get insights into what makes a good player and
what determines their market value. We conducted dimensionality reduction with PCA and tuned
lasso regression. Additionally we successfully created enhanced value models by position and
conducted regression analysis on value and the elasticity of value. An enhanced and reduced
value model that eliminates collinearity with feature engineering, and interaction terms as well
as out performs the original model was created. We identified the optimal classification methods
to predict a players overall rating. Also we came up with our own algorithm to rank features
and used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning. Players were clustered based on basic features.
The implications of our results can help train AI systems on what to look for when scouting
players, and help clubs financially structure contracts based on player attributes.
